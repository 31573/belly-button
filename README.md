Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard! This interactive dashboard allows you to explore the fascinating world of microbes that colonize human navels. You can view the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in each individual's belly button, visualize the abundance of these microbes through bar and bubble charts, and explore demographic information associated with each sample.

Dataset: Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset
Features:
Horizontal Bar Chart:

Displays the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual's belly button.
Bar length represents the abundance of each OTU (sample_values).
OTU IDs are used as labels for the bars.
Hover over bars to view OTU labels.
Bubble Chart:

Visualizes each sample's microbial composition.
X-axis: OTU IDs.
Y-axis: Abundance of microbial species (sample_values).
Marker size represents sample_values.
Marker colors correspond to OTU IDs.
Hover over bubbles to view OTU labels.


All plots and demographic information update dynamically when a new sample is selected from the dropdown menu.
